## Create a PowerShell profile file
PowerShell will look for a profile file to initialize each time you open the terminal in the path that gets printed if you run his command: `echo $profile`. This file does not exist by default, so we need to create it.

- To create this file, simply run this command in your terminal `New-Item -Path $PROFILE -Type File -Force`
- Run the command `code $PROFILE` to open up the newly created file in VS Code
- Add the command `oh-my-posh init pwsh | Invoke-Expression` to the file, save
- Refresh your profile by running the command `. $PROFILE` in the terminal
- Your terminal should now look like this:

- These settings will be automatically initalized whenever you start the terminal from now on

## Add an Oh My Posh theme
- Open up the PowerShell profile file by running command `code $PROFILE` in your terminal
- Replace the command you just added with this (adding the `--config` part):
  - `oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH/jandedobbeleer.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression`
- If you save and refresh your terminal, you should see that the theme changed
- You can now go to the [theme page](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes) on the Oh My Posh website and look for whatever theme you want to try
- When you've found one, take the name and replace the `"jandedobbeleer"` part of the expression above, save, and refresh the terminal
- For example, I like the ["amro"](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes#amro) theme, so the full expression would be:
  - `oh-my-posh init pwsh --config "$env:POSH_THEMES_PATH/amro.omp.json" | Invoke-Expression`
- My terminal now looks like this:

- It is also possible to [adjust themes](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/customize#adjust-a-theme) if you want to read more about that.

## Customize PowerShell
### Add custom icons to the terminal
- Add the [`Terminal-Icons`](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Terminal-Icons) package
  - Open your terminal and run the command `Install-Module -Name Terminal-Icons`
- Go to your profile file (run the command `code $PROFILE`)
- Under the `oh-my-posh init` line, add this code:
  - `Import-Module -Name Terminal-Icons`
- Save and refresh your terminal
- You should now have custom icons in your terminal
  - Before:

### Add auto-complete and history functionality
- Add the [`PSReadLine`](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSReadLine) package
  - Open your terminal and run the command `Install-Module -Name PSReadLine -AllowPrerelease -Force`
- Go to your profile file (run the command `code $PROFILE`)
- Under the `Import-Module` line, add this code:
  - `Import-Module -Name PSReadLine`

- Add these lines under that:

```ps1
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History
Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionViewStyle ListView
Set-PSReadLineOption -EditMode Windows
```

- Save and refresh your terminal
- You should now have auto-complete and see a list of previous commands you've run in the terminal
